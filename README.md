## 🧪 Spaced Repetition Algorithm

This plugin implements the **SM-2 (SuperMemo-2) algorithm**, the gold standard for spaced repetition:

### Mathematical Foundation
- **E-Factor Update**: `EF_new = EF_old + (0.1 - (3-q)×(0.08 + (3-q)×0.02))`
- **Review Intervals**: 
  - First review: 1 day
  - Second review: 6 days
  - Subsequent: `I_n = I_(n-1) × EF_new`
- **Quality Scores**: 
  - Hard (1): Difficult recall, resets interval
  - Good (2): Successful recall with effort
  - Easy (3): Perfect recall

### Load Balancing
The plugin intelligently distributes reviews across days to prevent overwhelming study sessions:
- Short intervals (≤21 days): ±1 day fuzzing
- Medium intervals (≤180 days): ±5% fuzzing
- Long intervals (>180 days): ±2.5% fuzzing

## 🏗️ Architecture
